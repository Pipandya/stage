# [Stage Framework](http://www.stageframework.com)

Stage Framework is an experimental HTML5 and CSS3 framework for
digital magazine and newspaper publishing. It provides a web
application which features a magazine stand where users can browse
the published publications. The magazine browsing view relies
entirely on CSS3 3D transforms and transitions which makes the
framework highly experimental on certain platforms.
